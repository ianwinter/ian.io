So Americans want armed marshals on planes, well seems a bit pointless if they're going to let people with bullets get on the planes anyway. I heard a quote from an American chap who worked for the Travel Department (or whatever it is) and he'd said that although the suspect didn't necessarily have the bullets when he boarded the place at Washington DC's Dulles it was the likely source. What did he expect, you imagine it can't you, cabin service comes round "Hello Sir, would you like a drink... white wine, red, beer, round of bullets". Another commentator on BBC Radio 4 hd said which I agree with that we could end up spending so much time "following intelligence leads" that basic security checking would go overlooked.
