[MovableType](http://www.movabletype.org) version 2.661 has been released, so having just upgraded to 2.65 I thought I may as well go to 2.661. Nothing major is different, a security fix pretty much.

Whilst doing this I've also started to finally get the old *defusionx* content onto the site. I'm going to use MovableType to manage this content as well, using [Brad Choate's](http://www.bradchoate.com/weblog/2003/07/15/movable-type) method. One change can be made to his guide though now that 2.65 has been released. There is a standard tag [MTIfNonEmpty](http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_tags.html#miscellaneous%20tags) which can be used to replace Brad's [MTIfEmtpy](http://bradchoate.com/weblog/2002/07/08/mtifempty) plugin.

For users on 2.65+ when setting the Individual Entry Archive filename template, you can now use:

``` html
<$MTEntryCategory lower_case=“1”$><MTIfNonEmpty tag=“EntryCategory”>/</MTIfNonEmpty><$MTEntryTitle dirify=“1”$>.html
```
