This is a follow up to the earlier post that MS started having a go at Mike Rowe for his offending domain name. Today I read <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/35113.html">this article</a> on <em>The Register</em>. Unbelievable, however, not as bad as Gates' claim that he <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3426367.stm">forecasts victory over spam</a>. Erm, how?
