A day of updates.
Apple have finally announced that on March 6th they're going to talk about the iPhone roadmap and SDK [<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUKN2745545120080227?rpc=44">via</a>]
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> have launched a new design for the site. A cross between Facebook & Flickr in my opinion.
Google Docs has a slight tweak to it's toolbar making it more MS Office esq. Google also launched <a href="http://sites.google.com">Sites</a> for Google Apps, online wiki from all accounts. Need to get myself a Google Apps account to check it out.
