First impressions, well, it's erm OK. BTOpenZone connection is a bit slow and we have to pay which for a web conference isn't really that great.
Mike Arrington was quite interesting and apologised for the fact TechCrunch UK is no more. Chap from AOL didn't really say  a lot at all.
Most of the time so far has been trying to SubEthaEdit to work over bonjeur which BT have decided to not allow, would seem that port 80 is the only one open. Pants.
