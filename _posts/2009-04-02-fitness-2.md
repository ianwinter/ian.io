The fitness campaign continues for the most part successfully. I've kept to doing at least 1000m in the pool twice a week. It's taking about 40 minutes each time doing breast stroke which is ok, but, I'd like to do it quicker though on having attempted that last night I'm not sure how much quicker I can do that stroke. I think I may need to try out doing front crawl though I need a better pair of googles for that.
I've also kept up the gym working managing just over 8km again on the bike along with some arm work - although the day after swimming that wasn't a great plan!
