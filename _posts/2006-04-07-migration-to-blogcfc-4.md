I'm now eventually getting around to upgrading BlogCFC to version 4. I've got the data transfer, which, using the data transfer tool in <a href="http://www.navicat.com/">Navicat</a> was suprisingly painless. Even got it to transfer and recreate the full DB pushing from my local machine up to the live server.
Got it running it "pure" form at the moment on my beta domain and have already included Steven's <a href="http://www.talkingtree.com/blog/index.cfm/2005/11/15/TagCloudPod">tag cloud</a> pod (cheers!).
Next on the list is to re-skin it, might actually take the time and do in proper xhtml/css this time, though, might not! Also might look at a redesign. One thing I was tempted to do is try and create some themes for the blog basing them on some ideas from the <a href="http://www.oswd.org">OSWD</a>. Also want to get fckeditor in there as well this time, maybe even some emoticons!
Edit: Why is trying to design a new style so damn hard!
