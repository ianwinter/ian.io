Going to see a bit more from me on the AJAX front as I've just started playing with it properly. Got a couple of sites where I have need for some AJAX UI elements, the 2 main ones being a star based rating system and a Google suggest style tag lookup for an admin area (more on these later).
In my hunt for examples I found a basic example over at <a href="http://www.ajaxfreaks.com/quickcode/XMLHttpRequest/1.php" target="_blank">ajaxfreaks.com</a> which if you're just starting out is quite good.
On the CF front you have a few examples out and about but not many (again more later), one of the best I've found is Rob Gonda's <a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/projects/ajaxcfc">ajaxCFC</a> project.
