Blackstone, the next version of ColdFusion is well under development now and following on from Ben Forta's tour many rumours and stuff came out. There is a page on <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/coldfusion/articles/blackstone.html">Macromedia's</a> site with exactly what Ben actually said and what actually is happening.
The new features are looking good, the event gateway, reporting functionality and also the admin api look particularly of interest. The deployment abililty as well will be great for the product I think, and open a lot of new options.
