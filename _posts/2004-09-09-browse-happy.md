The latest, and in my opinion very good, campaign from <a href="http://webstandards.org/act/campaign/happy/">WASP</a> (Web Standards Project) is <a href="http://browsehappy.com">Browse Happy</a>. Basically it tells you why you shouldn't use IE and how all the other browsers, Mozilla, Safari, Opera and Firefox (which I use) are all superior, nicer and better.
Try a new browser today!
