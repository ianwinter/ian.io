Saw <a href="http://www.queenonline.com/wewillrockyou/">We Will Rock You</a> up at The Dominion in London on Saturday night and, well, it ROCKED!
All the cast we awesome, particularly the women who played Scaramouche, what a set of pipes! My god she could sing. The lead man playing Galilieo was also very good.
The elements on Ben Eltons humour definatly show through, but, it's a good thing. If you like Queen I strongly recommend you go see it, it is expensive but, well worth it.
