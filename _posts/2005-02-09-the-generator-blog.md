From the site:
"This blog is not about those machines used to change mechanical energy into electrical energy. It's about software that creates software. Software to play around and have fun with."
If you've found a "generator" on the net, <a href="http://generatorblog.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">this blog</a> probably has a link to it.
Some notable one's are the <a href="http://apps.everamber.com/alpha/">Transparent PNG generator</a> and the <a href="http://www.creatimation.net/extra/photopalette/index.php"> Color Palette Generator</a>.
