Found this a while ago, but, with a need for dynamic image rating widget looked up <a href="http://ditchnet.org/dhtmlgallery/" target="_blank">Todd Ditchendorf's DHTML Gallery</a> again.
There is a very good collection of cross browser DHTML widgets to do all sorts, iPod style navigation, image cropping, google/ig clonce, image resizer and a whole lot more.
