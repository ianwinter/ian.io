This is one of those random posts that I just need to talk about.
Over Christmas the Sky Guide planner has been playing slightly odd, slightly dancey Christmas tracks. That's all well and good, I reckon there was about 5 or 6 of them in total.
So why is now we're subjected to the same 2 poxy tracks all year long! I know they occasionally change and yes, I can turn it off, but, come on Sky... give me something new to listen to!
