First blog post in a while, but, here goes anyway!
I've got a Phatnoise MP3 system in my Golf and have had the same music on the cartridge for ages. The problem is the company who make it don't really seem to be around to much and I think have been acquired by Harmon. Either way if you need the latest version of the Phatnoise music / media manager I suggest you go check out <a href="http://forum.phathack.com/index.php/topic,1053.0.html">this post </a>on a very handy forum!
