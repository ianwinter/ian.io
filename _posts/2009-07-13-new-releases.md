A few new releases for you to catch up on. Firstly <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2009/07/wordpress-2-8-1/" target="_blank">Wordpress 2.8.1</a> - essentially a bug fix and security release by the look of it but worth doing anyway, quick note that if you get stuck with a maintenance page check in your web root for a file called .maintenance, just rename that and the site will come back.
Next up two public beta's from Adobe. <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion9/" target="_blank">ColdFusion 9</a> boasting some new useful and some not so useful/utterly pointless changes and the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusionbuilder/" target="_blank">ColdFusion Builder</a> which can either be standalone or as a plugin to Eclipse.
