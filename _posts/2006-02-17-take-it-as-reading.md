The mighty Royals continue to reign over the championship and interestingly have "accumulated the most points, won the most games and tasted defeat the fewest times of any of the teams in the top four divisions so far this season." (From <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/reading/4717202.stm">BBC News</a>)
I think that the 106 point record achievable and would make this by far the Royals best season, and, they deserve it.
Come on you Royals!!!
