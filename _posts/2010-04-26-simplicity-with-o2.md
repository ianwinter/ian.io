If you've got yourself an iPhone, particular a 3G, odds are you're out of, or, coming up to being out of contract. You're probably paying &pound;35/m right now as well. If like me you're holding on for June/July to see if a new iPhone is launched, which, it probably will be you're not going to want to jump into a 18/24 month contract to upgrade to a 3GS (albeit tempting). O2 actually seem to have an answer in their reasonable new <a href="http://shop.o2.co.uk/tariffs/simplicity/iphone/1_month" target="_blank">Simplicity</a> SIM only tariffs. For &pound;20/m you can get unlimited texts and 300 minutes inclusive.
It's also really easy to switch online once you've found the right links. If you click on the "Shop" dropdown at the top you'll see an <a href="http://shop.o2.co.uk/Mobile_Phone_Upgrades" target="_blank">Upgrade Your Phone</a> link. Follow that, enter your mobile number and then the code you'll get by SMS. Once in you can pick from the don't want a phone section and just pick the new tariff. You can also just go on a month to month rolling contract which is great, saves you money and hopefully makes you ready for the iPhone 4G. You can also "downgrade" to these tariffs and save &pound;5/m if you go for a 12 month contract.
I've gone through the process just now and as yet not received a confirmation email but hopefully that'll turn up soon!
<strong>Edit:</strong> Still no email but now the O2 iPhone app shows I'm on to simplicity 20 tariff.
