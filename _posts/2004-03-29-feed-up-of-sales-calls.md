<a title="TPS Registration" href="http://www.tpsonline.org.uk/tps/">TPS Registration</a>Found this after seeing something at work about it, it's the Telephone Preference Service website. Basically, and I quote, "The Telephone Preference Service (TPS) helps you to make sure your telephone number is no longer available to organisations who may telephone you with offers and information you do not wish to receive."Well worth it if you ask me, stop automated computers ringing you up or people from India who you can't understand!
