Oh yes, it's almost here....
<blockquote><p>
Three years after the Battle of Geonosis, the Clone Wars are coming to a close. Obi-Wan Kenobi, now a general, is sent by the Republic to bring down remaining Separatists Count Dooku and General Grievous. Meanwhile Chancellor Palpatine has become corrupt, proclaiming himself Emperor and, with Anakin Skywalker's help, begins to turn the Republic into the Galactic Empire. As Anakin ultimately becomes the evil we know as Darth Vader, Padme goes into hiding and, at the end of one war, another conflict we know all too well is about to begin.
