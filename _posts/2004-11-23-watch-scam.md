Thinking about buying a Claude Valentini or Krug-Baumen watch, as I was from <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=4943236972">eBay</a>, well DON'T. It's a scam and has been uncovered by the BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/watchdog/reports/consumer29.shtml">WatchDog</a> programme. Update link <a href="http://forums.ebay.com.au/thread.jspa?threadID=300009612&tstart=120&mod=1118057730279">eBay  Forums</a>.
I was convinced, good job I did some research. I thought it was odd when only eBay links came up and a dodgy *main* site. Anyway, you live and learn.
