<p>As an operations guy, graphs are always good. They can show patterns, trends, peaks and troughs and of course are useful when it comes to analysis and planning for feature launches and maintenance.</p>

<p>Around 3pm on the 22nd June something happened that caused our member activity graph to take a little wobble.</p>

<p>Apparently there was a football match on at 3pm... Here are some of the team watching: you'll see the developers up front and centre!Â Shame we won't be watching any more matches after <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_51">Sunday's result</a>.</p>
