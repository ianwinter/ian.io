Windows Live, hmm, not sounding promising.
"Firefox Users: Firefox support is coming soon. Please be patient :-)"
Good start, not, though ironically it does actually work just looks a bit crap. OK I can check my mail, what mail I don't know, it doesn't say. I can use feeds, I think, again doesn't say what's supported. Yes, it's in beta, but, at least when google release beta's like their <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">personalised homepage</a> it works, in all browsers.
Don't give up the day job Micro$oft.
