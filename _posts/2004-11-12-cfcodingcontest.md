Intersting new site that's popped up run by a chap from <a href="http://www.rawnet.com">RawNet</a>, a UK web design company.
<a href="http://tech.badpen.com/cfcontest/"><CF_CodingContest></a>
Taken from the site:
<blockquote><p>"So what's the point of all this? The basic idea is to have an informal contest where people can either brush up on some CF skills that they may not use in their everyday coding, or for those that already know everything to dazzle everyone else with their mighty coding knowledge!"</blockquote>
