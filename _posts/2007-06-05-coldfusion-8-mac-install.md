Got the public beta running on my Macbook the other day and I have to say I was impressed. The install on a Intel Core2 Duo went painlessly and it has to be said quickly! I installed the server config with the built-in web server to start with and it started up first time of asking! A few quick tweaks to the apache connector shell script that ships to get the correct command and pathing for the MAC and apache2 was up and running serving out my sites. Now to test it properly :)
