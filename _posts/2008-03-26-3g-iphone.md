Now the Apple rumour mill is active at the quietest of times but the 3G iPhone stories keep on popping up. Good, cause, I want one (even though I already have a regular one)... anyway the <a href="http://www.ipodobserver.com/story/35268">latest story</a> [<a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/03/25/3g-iphone-already-ordered-by-apple/">via</a>] suggests Apple have placed orders for 10M units and they may have OLED screens.
