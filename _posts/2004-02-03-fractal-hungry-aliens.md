Have fractal hungry aliens taken over <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>? A suggestion pondered to me my a mate who asked "why does the google logo has fractals on it today?". A very good question, the logo is on show <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/fractals/quaternionjulia/">here</a> with some text. A possible explanation is that it relates to when fractals were <a href="http://students.bath.ac.uk/ma0lap/discovered2.HTML">first discovered</a>, either that or a google admin has a strange fractal fetish.I know I know, what's a fractal I hear you cry, or not, anyway, if you're still curious here's a couple of pages that tell you more:
