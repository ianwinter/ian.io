Had a challenge at work to write a PHP version of a ColdFusion site I've got. Fine. Thought this won't be too hard, never done php but everyone claims it's easy. 2 days later I'd got the site working have self taught with a little help from Google. I'm not going to making any career moves though to php though! My god it's hard work. The site I did needed to utilise URL variables and do some list manipulation. In CF nice and easy, URL. and the various List functions. PHP, oh no, `GET_HTTP_` blah blah, to get my list variables they have to go into an array which you do my using a `explode()`` function, which in itself I thought was amusing. Anyway, I did it and it works, I'm not doubting php is hugely powerful but CF is a damn site easier, quicker and nicer. Long live CF!
