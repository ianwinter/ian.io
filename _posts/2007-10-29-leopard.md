Finished installing, well upgrading my new Mac Mini from Tiger to Leopard. Took about an hour an was painless.
One issue with the last.fm player not working but after a quick scoot over to the forums Robert's your Mother's brother and there's a <a href="http://www.last.fm/forum/34905/_/328298">fixed version</a>.

All hail the shiny white hardware gods!
