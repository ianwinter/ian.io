If you're interested in Flex then go take a look at Lucas Sherwood's (from Macromedia) <a href="http://www.thebitbucket.net/weblog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=6879E490-E081-51EF-A76B90FE61741CF9"> blog</a>.
Basically if you meet certain criteria you can now get Flex for free, which, is a great thing.
