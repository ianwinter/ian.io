With the announcement of the new iPhone 3GS the predictable rage at upgrades is now the issue. It's not unexpected as the handsets aren't subsidised however still annoying to those people who want the latest and greatest.
o2 have now published their <a href="http://shop.o2.co.uk/update/paymonth.html" target="_blank">upgrade policy</a> on how you can get a 3GS. Basically, buy a pay as you go phone, pay up your remaining monthly contract and sign a new one or dependent on how much you pay monthly take advantage of the early upgrade windows.
I'll certainly put 3.0 on my phone but if it's worth upgrading as much as I'd like to I'm not sure. In my case with 9 months left I think the pay out contract option would be cheapest - still very expensive though. Of course there's always eBay...
