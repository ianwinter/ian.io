Logged into to Gmail this morning, as you do, to be greeted by a nice big red message flash at the top of my window:
<blockquote><p>Firebug is known to make Google Mail slow unless it is configured correctly. Fix this   Hide</blockquote>
Clicking on the "Fix this" link takes you to a <a href="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=77355">support page</a> detailing how to make some changes aimed to improve performance.
I have to say I've not really noticed any performance issues and I have had Firebug running for some time!
[Edit]
Interestingly I've just disabled Firebug on the mail.google.com domain and reloaded my inbox and it's noticeably quicker. When I click on a conversation it loads instantly whereas with Firebug on I used to get a "loading" delay. Based on what I know Firebug does and how Gmail works it's not surprising but, it's interesting that Google are telling user's to disable it.
