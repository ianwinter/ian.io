Taken from BBC News the announcement that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4875258.stm" target="_blank">America Online to rebrand as AOL</a>, I suppose Time Warner have loads of money, why not do something daft!
I'm sure major corp's have their reasons, like Intel recently, but I'm still not sure on major re-brands when they're household names. I guess it does generate publicity and refresh the image, but still, is it worth it? I'm sure marketing folk (eek I said folk when I'm not American!) will argue otherwise.
Still won't make AOL a company I'd recommend, sorry!
