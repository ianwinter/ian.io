Not sure what made me book up these tickets, but, damn glad I did. Jack Dee's on his 2005 tour, and, he's very very good.
I've always liked him and am getting more into the comedy scene. The show at Reading's Hexagon was a full sell out and it really helped the atmosphere. As well as a funny "stock" show he also had a lot of local based humour and takes on stuff which was very amusing. Especially the Cemetery Junction related bits, that will make sense if you know Reading at all!
If you get the chance, go see him.
