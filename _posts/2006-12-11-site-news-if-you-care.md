Having said I'd almost decided on a new design for site which really was blatant lie as I had about 4 designs on the go, I think, I might actually have decided this time.
The site might get a bit funky as not only am I going to have a splash page style homepage the blog is going to be upgraded and the database moved, oh, and it'll also be changing server. All in all if it comes back I'll be happy!
Naturally when this'll actually happen I don't know, hopefully this weekend, but hey... I'll settle for this year!
