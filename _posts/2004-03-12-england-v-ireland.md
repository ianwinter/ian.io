Well, not sure what to say <a title="BBC SPORT | Rugby Union | Six Nations | Dallaglio demands reaction" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/3541115.stm">to this</a>, yes we lost (19-13) and I suppose the better team won. We didn't play well at all, though I hope they get an ear bashing and beat the Welsh or we'll never live it down... Come on boys!!!
