<blockquote><p>
It is with great regret that we announce the closure of Fopp.
Our store chain is profitable, well regarded and loved by our loyal customers and staff. However we have failed to gain the necessary support from major stakeholders, suppliers and their credit insurers to generate sufficient working capital to run our expanding business.
We would like to thank staff and customers for their support over the past 25 years.
Any outstanding website orders have now been cancelled and will not be fulfilled or charged.

This sucks, Fopp was cool.
