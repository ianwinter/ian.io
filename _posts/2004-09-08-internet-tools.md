Been doing a lot of domain name migration and messing about lately and have needed some web based tools to check up on them. Here for your use are some I've been playing with.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.all-nettools.com/toolbox">www.all-nettools.com</a> - Whois, ping, traceroute
<li><a href="http://www.dnsreport.com">www.dnsreport.com</a>
<li><a href="http://www.samspade.org">www.samspade.org</a>
<li><a href="http://www.123-reg.co.uk">www.123-reg.co.uk</a> - Get all domains through this lot, very good, free changes
</ul>
A web design one here that's very useful if you're trying to find matching and complimentary colours etc. Check out <a href="http://www.easyrgb.com">EasyRGB.com</a>
