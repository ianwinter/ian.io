Just started looking into <a href="http://microformats.org/" rel="tag">Microformats</a> and as such have added an hcard, some rel="tag" and rel="bookmark" links into the blog.
I'm using both <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2006/12/introducing-operator">Operator</a> and <a href="http://blog.codeeg.com/tails-firefox-extension-03/">Tails</a> to see what's going on.
Nicely pointless, yet very festive, icons added to December posts. Simple tweak to the output using <a href="http://www.cfdocs.org/day">day()</a> and <a href="http://www.cfdocs.org/month">month()</a> ensures the magic is limited. Cheers to <a href="http://www.ndesign-studio.com/resources/christmas-holiday-icons/">Nick at n.design</a> for the free icons.
This will be the last code update I think before Christmas, might tweak the entry page tomorrow hangover depending!
