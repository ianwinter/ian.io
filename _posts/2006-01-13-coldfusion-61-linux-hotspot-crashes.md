Had another hotspot crash on a Linux server again today after months of not having any. Doing a bit of googling and finding myself back on <a href="http://www.talkingtree.com/blog/index.cfm/2004/5/21/hscrashlog0504" target="_blank">Steven Erat's</a> very useful blog I found a user comment saying that in Sun's JRE 1.4.2_10 they seem to have fixed the problem. As a result I've updated it along with a couple of hotfixes to CF and all seems well.
You can get the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html" target="_blank">JRE</a> from Sun's Java site.
