Air Marshalls / Sky Marshalls whatever you want to call them are a stupid idea. I refer to one of the many [BBC News articles](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2590309.stm) on the subject. For years we've tried and more recently to stop guns getting on planes yet in Mr Bush's and Mr Bluuuuuurs, sorry I mean Blair's opinion putting guns onto planes is a good idea! RUBBISH! I heard a correspondent on BBC Radio 4 comment that as most of the terrorists who do these terrible things are determined to die for their cause how a bloke (or woman) with a gun would deter them. I'm not supported terrists at all, 9/11 was terrible no doubt, but guns on planes is not the answer. Right, off the soapbox now.
