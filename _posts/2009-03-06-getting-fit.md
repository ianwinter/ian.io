I decided as a new year's resolution to try and get a bit fitter. That didn't really happen so in the last few weeks I've been sticking to it by going to the pool twice a week and the gym at least once or twice. First off in the pool I did 20 lengths which is 500m. Last time I got that up to 24/600m and I'm hoping that by the end of the month I can be doing 40/1000m. I do feel better in myself for doing more exercise and also trying to eat better. We shall see if it pays off!
