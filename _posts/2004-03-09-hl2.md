Just check my Amazon account as I pre-ordered the game last Septemeber and it now says this will be released on the 12th Novemeber 2004!!! What are they doing! I saw a thing a while ago saying it was due to the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/33260.html">source code leak</a> but come on guys, over a year late? 
Ah well. Give's me time to save for a nicer PC to run it on!
