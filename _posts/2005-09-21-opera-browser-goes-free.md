Yep, Opera 8.5 is now free, no license, no adverts. Will it make a difference? Will you download it? I won't, still feels cheap to me. I'll stick to Firefox (1.0.7 out now btw as is 1.5 Beta).
I've read in a few places that it does have some issues with M$ ISA so may cause some issues for some, good old M$ in the way, again. Unfortunatly I don't think IE's share is going to go down very quickly anytime soon. FF has dented it but probably not enough for them to give a shit.
