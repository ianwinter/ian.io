Wow, it works! Been playing with <a href="http://new.bastish.net/cgi-bin/mfop2/index.cgi">MFOP2</a> a mobile blogging thingie that lets me send an email from my phone (SE T610) straight to my blog. How cool! Need to work on the formatting as you can see but hey!Was going to write a CF version but, it's hard because you can email a pop3 box fine, but how can you trigger something to check the email and use the <a href="http://www.movableytpe.org">MT</a> XML-RPC interface to post. You could have a schedule task but that's a bit long winded. I'll have a think on this though.
