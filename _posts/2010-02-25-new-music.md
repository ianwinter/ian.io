Thanks to a simple link over to <a href="http://audioporncentral.com/">audioporncentral</a> from a mate I've discovered all sorts of crazy cool music in the last fe days. Now it's not everyone's taste, but, it's damn cool. Mainly mashups of assorted but general high quality. The particular standout winner are <a href="http://www.kleptones.com">The Kleptones</a>. Their website has all their music available, for free, mp3 download... just the way it should be! My favourite so far is <a href="http://www.kleptones.com/pages/downloads_ud.html">Uptime</a> from the uptime/downtime record. It's awesome, so many tunes so little time! The Bestival live also is worth a play.
