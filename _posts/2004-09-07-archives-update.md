OK then, all the archives are now imported and working. Please note though the formatting may be a bit messed up, mainly line breaks missing and maybe some broken images. I will get round to fixing these when I get some time.
Also if you've got old links, for example, /news/000086.cfm, through some funky magic you'll automatically be popped over to /go/000086 which is an alias to the actually location of the page. Nice hey?
The categories have been changed around a bit and the "Cam Pics" category gone completely, all the aliases should still work though.
Enjoy.
