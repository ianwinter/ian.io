Just a quick warning, got the latest Coldfusion trial download off the MM site for Linux (coldfusion-701-lin.bin) and it doesn't work. It installs fine, but, won't start.
Downloaded the old version coldfusion-70-lin.bin, installed it, patched it and it starts up fine. Not sure if this is all OS's but certainly the Linux one is dodgy.
