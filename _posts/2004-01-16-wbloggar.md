Discovered this lying around on my hard disk as I was doing a routine tidy up. Couldn't remember what it was so popped over to Google and did a search for it. Off to the [home page](http://wbloggar.com) and I downloaded the latest version 3.03. If all goes well this post should appear, having been posted from w.bloggar. For those not in the know, basically w.blogger is a program you can run on Windows which allows you to post to a whole load of blog programs, including [MovableType](http://www.movabletype.org), [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) and [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com). Hopefully they'll be a Linux version along soon as well!
