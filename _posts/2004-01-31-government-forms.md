Clear as mud, that's what they are! First moan is you have to trapse all the way to the Post Office to get the form in the first place, erm dur, they're all "e" versions somewhere, stick 'em on a website, hey forms.gov.uk not tricky. Anyway, form in question is reclaiming Premimum Bonds. Most of the form is fine but one bit about how you only actually repay part, ooo grr. Rant over.
