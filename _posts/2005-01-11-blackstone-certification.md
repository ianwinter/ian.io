Interesting <a href="http://www.houseoffusion.com/cf_lists/messages.cfm/threadid:37533/forumid:4">post</a> taken off the <a href="http://www.houseoffusion.com">cf-talk</a> mailing regarding <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/coldfusion/blackstone">Blackstone</a> (CF7) certification.

You will need to recertify on the new Blackstone exam. We offer a 25% upgrade discount for currently certified professionals. Please circle back when the new ColdFusion exam launches.
So, if you haven't gotten certified yet and you don't have a pressing reason to do so before Blackstone, it seems that you'd be better waiting until then.  I just figured I'd share the information that I received since it seemed to be a popular topic.
