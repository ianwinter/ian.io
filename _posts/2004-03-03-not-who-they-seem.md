Do you ever wonder about famous people who do other famous voices that no-one realises? Well, I didn't, until today. Jam posed the question after recently watching an episode of the <a href="http://www.ninjaturtles.com/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>... 
"Where have I heard Shredders voice before?" after a little searching around on the net, the answer has been revealed, and it's something we believe should be shared with you, the world.
 The voice of Shredder is infact and was Philip Banks from the Fresh Prince Of Bel Air... oh yes! Don't believe it check out:
