Rebuilt my PC, again, recently and need to put a virus scanner back on. I've been using Norton for the last 4/5 years but each year it gets bigger and bigger taking more disk space and more memory up so was looking for alternatives. I had recommend to me AVG from <a href="http://www.grisoft.com">Grisoft</a> and after some hunting I found the link to the <a href="http://free.grisoft.com/doc/1" target="_blank">free edition</a>. So far I can say I'm impressed, seems to be just fine, certainly doesn't slow the machine down like Norton 2006 did!!
