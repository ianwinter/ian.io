Picked up the link to this from <a href="http://www.petefreitag.com">Pete Freitag's</a> site. The <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-perf06304/?ca=dgr-lnxw07BlogFix">article</a> over on IBM's site is really interesting, it details a site called blog-city which is running on some farily old hardware and with BlueDragon.
There's some excellent links on Pete's site and a good thing for visualising garbage collection.
