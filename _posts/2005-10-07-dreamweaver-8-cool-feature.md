Just accidently found a really cool feature in Dreamweaver 8. If you select a block of code and hit "CTRL + T" you can type in a CF tag and surround the selected block of code, ideal for cfoutput, cfquery &amp; cfif to name a few, ooo, and cftry.
Very handy. I think, and from the last version I didn't think I'd say it, but, I actually like DW8. The code editor works, it doesn't crash, it doesn't randomly delete code, code collapse is back (ohh the Studio 4.5 memories) and the "CTRL + T" functionality. Very cool. Nice job MM.
