If you're running on UNIX and are interested in .NET for some crazy reason, you might like to have a look at <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/about/index.html" target="_blank">Mono</a>.
Taken from their site:
"Mono is a comprehensive open source development platform based on the .NET framework that allows developers to build Linux and cross-platform applications with unprecedented productivity. Mono's .NET implementation is based on the ECMA standards for C# and  the Common Language Infrastructure."
Will be interesting to see how this progresses and see if M$ go and jump on them or more unlikely help them. Not sure they can jump on it and stop them, but I'm sure they'll try.
