Now I'm not going to get into the argument that the war on Iraq was almost certainly wrong and George Bush is a muppet (see what i've done there ;) ), instead I'm going to point you at a few sites I've found about Iraq and what's going on.I found the blog, [Where is Raed?](http://dear_raed.blogspot.com), a while ago and went back to it today and had a read. It's a really good view of what's *really* going on not we're told is going on.

Couple of other sites I picked of interest:

* [Occupation Watch](http://www.occupationwatch.org/)
* [Al Jazeera](http://english.aljazeera.net/HomePage)
