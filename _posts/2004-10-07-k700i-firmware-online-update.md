Sony Ericsson have launched an <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/updateservice/K700/frameset.htm">online update service</a> for the <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/K700/index.aspx">K700</a> phone.
Basically it allows you to update the firmware online, yourself, without the need to take it to a <abbr title="Sony Ericsson">SE</abbr> Service Center.
You'll need the Sync Station software installed and also you'll have to get hold of or buy a <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=global&lc=en&ver=4001&template=pp4_1_1&zone=pp&lm=pp4_1&pid=10161">DSS-25</a> (Desk Synchronization Stand). I got mine of Ebay which was the cheapest I could find. You may need to go and download the <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=gb&lc=en&ver=4000&template=ps1_1_3_2&zone=ps&lm=ps1_1&pid=10161">drivers</a> for the DSS-25 as mine didn't come with a driver disk.
Once you've got the Update Software, Sync Station software and the DSS-25 installed you're ready to go.
Took about 10-15 minutes to do the full upgrade on ADSL.
