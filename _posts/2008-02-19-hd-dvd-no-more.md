After much speculation and comparison to the VHS Betamax wars of old a winner has emerged in the High Def. movie market. Toshiba have <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/19/official-hd-dvd-dead-and-buried-format-war-is-over/">officially announced</a> (<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/19/official-hd-dvd-dead-and-buried-format-war-is-over/">via</a>) that they are no longer going to produce HD DVD's. Considering that at least 5 of the major studios have gone with the Sony backed Blueray it's hardly surprising. Hopefully this will mean that consuming units start coming down in price.
