Amid the ever entertainment Apple rumour mill so long awaiting updates have today popped out. Updates to the Macbook and Macbook Pros.
Nothing massive really, the screens on the MBP's perhaps. Specs mainly.
This taken from <a href="http://www.applegazette.com/macbook-pro/apple-introduces-new-macbook-and-macbook-pro-models/">Apple Gazette</a>.
<blockquote><p>
The Macbook Pro now features the same multi-touch trackpad featured on the Macbook Air, but neither the Macbooks nor the Macbook Pros feature any real significant cosmetic changes. The new MacBook Pro features the latest Intel Core 2 Duo technology with up to a 2.6 GHz processor with 6MB of shared L2 cache; up to 4GB of 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM memory and up to a 300GB hard drive, plus NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT graphics with up to 512MB of video memory.
The MacBook lineup comes in three models and includes faster processors and larger hard drives across the line; white 2.1 GHz and 2.4 GHz models with 120GB or 160GB 5400 rpm hard drives and a black 2.4 GHz model with a 250GB 5400 rpm hard drive, previously only available as an option. The 2.4 GHz MacBook models ship with 2GB of memory standard, expandable up to 4GB across the line.
