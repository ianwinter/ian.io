I've often wondered if you can run the server installs of CF7 & 8 side by side and after a quick Google search I found <a href="http://www.tomdeman.com/machblog/index.cfm?event=showEntry&entryId=FAA22A68-C29D-0239-77C89FE2F6C8CBCD">this post</a> (<a href="http://www.robgonda.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/9/12/Windows-XP--Apache--CF7--CF8-side-by-side">via</a>) which goes through the steps very clearly. Suffice to say I've now got CF7 as my default and selected vhosts running with CF8.
It's probably a bit more intensive on the server than via JRun, but, in my opinion far less faf!
