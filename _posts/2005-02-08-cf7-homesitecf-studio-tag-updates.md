If you're using CFMX7 with either Homesite or CFStudio you're going to want the VTM's / tag updates. Go have a look at <a href="http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=e&entry=1497" target="_blank">Forta's</a> blog for a link to the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/coldfusion/downloads/">downloads</a> page.
You can get the DWMX extension update on that page as well.
