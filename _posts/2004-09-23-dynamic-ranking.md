This came up from a post over in the <a href="http://www.easycfm.com/forums/viewmessages.cfm?Forum=10&Topic=3539" target="_blank">EasyCFM.com</a> forum. It's all
about dynamic ranking, mainly using JavaScript. It's like you want to rate your "things" 1-5 but don't want to manually update the lists.
Hard to explain so easier if you <a href="##" onclick="launchCodeView('/coldfusion/code/ranking.cfm');">look at the code</a> or <a href="/coldfusion/code/ranking.cfm">the example</a>. Thanks to CJ for the JS bit.
