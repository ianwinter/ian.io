Just been sent an email with a link to and amusing page on Microsoft's site: [Running the World's Busiest Corporate Web Site on Windows Server 2003](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/evaluation/overview/dotnet/runningondotnet.mspx "Running the World's Busiest Corporate Web Site on Windows Server 2003")

Pay particular attention to the Running Ahead of Schedule paragraph where the statement is made

> We're seeing crazy uptime numbers now, like three months, six months. I fully expect we'll see a year of uptime when Windows Server 2003 is finished

Hmm, now I work mainly with Sun Solaris boxes, if we got uptime of 3 months I'd have grief! I think most of the production boxes are running at well over 400 days! Except the dev box but hey! Here's a [nice screen capture](http://uk.glbx.net/~andy/pics/misc/dotnet-crazy.png), just to prove it.
