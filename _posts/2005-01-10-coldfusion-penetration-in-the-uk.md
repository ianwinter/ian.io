Ben Forta <a href="http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=e&entry=1464">posted</a> in reply to <a href="http://www.beynon.org.uk/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=537C9140-3FFB-32D3-57AB976FBB635E1E">John B's</a> post about his seeming lack of information regarding CF exposure in the UK.
I'll repeat here the comment I made over on <a href="http://theservicefactory.blogspot.com/2005/01/coldfusion-penetration-in-uk.html">Neil's</a> blog that if Macromedia payed more attention in the UK, and Europe for that matter they might notice!
CFEurope is yet another example of this, the story is there wasn't enough sponsorship which is undoubtably true, but, if MM wanted it to happen I'm sure they could have contributed more than they did.
Sorry for the rant but hey, needs to be said.
