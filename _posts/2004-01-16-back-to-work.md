Oh the joys of going back to work. It's hard to sound so synical whilst typing, one of the big problems with text on the net, tone of voice. Anyway. Well the alarm went of at 7:00, to be honest I'd forgotten what that time of day looks like having not been up before 9:30 for just over 2 weeks. Ah well, think of the money, hmm. On another note at least I didn't have to listen to Sara Cox though when the radio came on, now Radio 1 have [Chris Moyles](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chrismoyles/index.shtml) doing the breakfast show, at last someone has seen the light! Good show Chris, not that I expect you'll read this!
