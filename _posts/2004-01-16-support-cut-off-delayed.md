In true Microsoft style another one of their deadlines/key dates has been pushed back. This article on [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/34826.html) details how they've decided to delay the support cut off date for Windows 98, 98 SE & ME until June 2006. It was supposed to happen this Friday. Clearly they've finally realised that no-one is prepared to constantly upgrade to the next best version, and that people actually are happy with 98. Well, I doubt it, but hey.
