Found <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=47212">this post</a> in the <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org">MozillaZine</a> forums, in specific the Thunderbird section relating to getting Thunderbird reading hotmail/msn/yahoo mail accounts. I guess this'd work with Mozilla as well.
