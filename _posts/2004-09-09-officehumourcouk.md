The new version of <a href="http://www.office-humour.co.uK">office-humour.co.uk</a> is now live and running smoothly (touch wood!), it seems to also be a lot quicker.
For more details check out the <a href="http://www.office-humour.co.uk/site/about.cfm">about</a> page.
On another note an interesting <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MLU/is_1_5/ai_96531679">CPU article</a> and making CFMX "fly".
