My preferred desktop <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> client right now is the excellent <a href="http://www.destroytoday.com/projects/destroytwitter">DestroyTwitter</a>. It's got everything your need and is pretty nifty all round.
In the latest beta you can customise the themes and as I was messing about with a few things I've created one for me that's based on the scheme of this site. If you like those colours then you can grab the <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/ianwinter.dtwt">theme file</a>. Just double click it and it should install.
Here's a little more about DestroyTwitter:
<blockquote><p>DestroyTwitter is a robust but compact Twitter application built to run on Mac, Windows, and Linux using Adobe AIR. It consists of a series of canvases that constantly update to keep tweets current and up-to-date using notifications that appear immediately after a new tweet arrives. DestroyTwitter also features complete direct messaging functionality. Messages and tweets can be replied to with the original visible for quick and easy reference. A search function is also available to track anything that's being talked about.</blockquote>
