Saw Bryan Adams and Wembley Arena last Thursday. Having turned up late thanks to the hell of Hanger Lane traffic the set was very good. It was suppose to be for an album launch, but, he hasn't finished it so he said he toured anyway. Nice to hear all the old stuff as well and not too much newer bits.
