I was introduced to Amy's Ghost by a friend (<a href="http://twitter.com/timblair" target="_blank">@timblair</a>) as he knows Amy (lead singer). Since seeing them once live at Global in Reading I've really enjoyed their music. They played at Reading and Leeds this weekend and the highlights are online at <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/festivals/readingandleeds/2010/artists/amysghost/" target="_blank">BBC&nbsp;Introducing</a>. If you like it go buy the album from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dance-of-Defeat/dp/B003UR6XYM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dmusic&amp;qid=1283241233&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.
