Well didn't that all just get a bit more fun. I understand that we need to be security conscience, fair enough, but why should the world be run by 1 country? The US have said that we will have to have machine readable passports to enter the USA by October 2004, if not you'll need a [VISA](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3378057.stm). In Rio they've decided to [check US passengers](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3366519.stm) as well. I reckon if they say everyone in the world should do it we should do it back. They need to learn they cannot rule the world. If their not careful people just aren't going to travel there. You used to have casual tourism, people just going away for a week here and there, but now it's going to be so hard to get anywhere they're just not going to bother! Well that's my view anyway.
