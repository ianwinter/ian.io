So I've got 50 Gmail invites all of a sudden, if you can come up with a creative reason why I should let ya have one , offer me something nice or in fact just drop me line ;) you can get your grubby mits on one. Drop me a mail at ianwinter [at] gmail [dot] com
I'd take a stab in the dark and guess they're probably coming very close to the end of the beta. Not sure why the hell they'd give 50 invites out otherwise.
