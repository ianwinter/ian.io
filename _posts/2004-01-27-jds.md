Right then, got the new HDD for my laptop, a nice shiny, and very tiny, Fujitsu MHT2060AT. Going to stick on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Win XP</a> to start with, then partition the disk up and stick on the new <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/index.html">Sun Java Desktop</a>. Should be fun.Once that's on I'll be testing out running CFMX6.1 on it so they'll be some information on that. Watch this space.
