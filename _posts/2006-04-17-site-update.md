Well things are now progressing quite well. I've migrated the site over to BlogCFC 4 (just as Ray announces full development on v5, typical!) and I've finally sorted a design. It's not original, but then most sites aren't, it's based on the <a href="http://getk2.com">K2</a> template for Wordpress with some tweaks.
The site will also have a bit of a content update with me posting the Ajax/CF port of the php star rating system I found.
As ever, watch this space.
