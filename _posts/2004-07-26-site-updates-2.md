As you may have noticed the site has got some more stuff published now. The "Also" and "About" pods are both now up. The <a href="/coldfusion/">ColdFusion</a> and <a href="/diabetes/">Diabetes</a> both have content in with a new tutorial (Windows 2000 System Dependencies) published.
The portfolio section, including archives, and the archived posts are 2 remaining things to be done before I can then start on new content.
That might get slightly delayed as a new release of <a href="http://www.office-humour.co.uk/">office-humour.co.uk</a> is due with a nice new, slick look and feel, full <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feeds, MySQL backend (no more crappy <abbr title="Microsoft">MS</abbr> Access). It's 80% complete now and should  be appearing in a browser near you soon.
<strong>Edit 22:04 -</strong> Also now on some posts you'll see an extra link in the footer section called "Alias". If I've created an alias for a post you can link to it via a shorter, less complex link, like: www.flatpackedworld.co.uk/go/alias_name. You can still link to the full entry by using the post title as well.
