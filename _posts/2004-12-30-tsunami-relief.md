Google has setup a page of links if you want to help with
<a href="http://www.google.com/tsunami_relief.html" target="_blank">Tsunami Relief</a>. More information can be found on the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/4126019.stm">BBC</a> news site.
The <a href="http://www.disaster.go.th/content/english/verenglish.php">official</a> site (english version) also provides information. It's running a bit slow, but that's not surprising.
Having known 2 sets of people caught up in this a colleague and a family member of a good friend, both home safely thankfully, it's a bit close to home! Thoughts go out to all who haven't been as lucky.
