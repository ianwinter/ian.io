Google is on a release spree again. This time yet another free service in the form of <a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/" target="_blank">Google Notebook</a>. It is a research type tool allowing you to save clips from various web sites into a notebook. Can't help think this is "inspired" by <a href="http://www.37signals.com/" target="_blank">37signals</a> Backpack or Writeboard apps but hey, still suspect it'll quite handy.
