Seems Google are out to take over the world. In an article on <a href="http://news.com.com/Google%20snaps%20up%20top%20Firefox%20programmer/2100-1032_3-5548682.html?part=rss&tag=5548682&subj=news.1032.5" target="_blank">CNET News.com</a> it announces they've hired <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/ben/">Ben Goodger</a>, the Lead Engineer for Mozilla Firefox. Should be interesting to see what happens.
On another note, Google have launched yet another tool, <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video (beta)</a> which lets you "search recent TV programs online".
