David Hasselhoff, a man of legend. Of course the one and only Michael Knight from Knightrider in charge of KITT, BayWatch hunk (to the women anyway) and now man of music. The Hoff and Pingu, an awesome thought and <a href="http://www.david-hasselhoff.com/downloads/pingudance.mp3">here</a> for your pleasure. Enjoy!
