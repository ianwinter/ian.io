<img src="/images/blog/rbs.jpg" align="right" hspace=10>The RBS <a href="http://www.6nations.net">6 Nations</a> is well underway now, of course world champions England are doing well. 
Bit of a shaky start in the Scotland game but successfully beat them <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/3503707.stm">35-13</a> at Murreyfield to retain the Calcutter Cup. Last weekend they also beat <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/3481783.stm">France</a> 50-9 at the Stade De France. Come on England!
