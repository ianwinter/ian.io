A little while back I had an email, via <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> from and editor at <a href="http://www.schmap.com">Schmap</a> saying that one of my photos had been short listed for the next version of their London travel guide.
For those who don't know, like me, this is what's Schmap is about.

The photo in question was a quick snap I'd taken with a Sony Ericsson K750i when I was up in London on Oxford Street outside of John Lewis back in December 2006. The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flatpackedworld/325471244/">original photo</a> on Flickr.
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flatpackedworld/325471244/" title="John Lewis, Oxford Street by flatpackedworld, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/141/325471244_4f6826da3b_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="John Lewis, Oxford Street" /></a>
Today I received another message congratulating me that my photo had been published! Kinda cool for a camera phone shot!
It's featured in the <a href="http://www.schmap.com/london/shopping_computers/#p=2805&i=2805_5.jpg">Computers & Shopping</a> section of the latest Schmap guide.
