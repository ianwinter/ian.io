Taken from <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5032832.stm" target="_blank">BBC NEWS</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> is to be debuing it's security package. 3 computers will be covered in the yearly fee of &pound;26.50 but the question would you actually trust them to care about your PC? Seems like a handy way to grab more information about your machine and also slipstream in updates to Windows without exactly telling you what their doing... or am I being a classic M$ synic?
We shall see.
