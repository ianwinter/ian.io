<img align="left" src="http://bigbrother.channel4.com/bigbrother/media/housemates/michelle/housematesmainpage_michelle.jpg"/>OK, for those of you not the UK, currently on <a href="http://www.channel4.com">Channel 4</a> is <a href="http://bigbrother.channel4.com/">Big Brother 5</a>. A reality TV show where the housemates are trapped in a house for 10 weeks with camera's everywhere.
One of the housemates, Michelle, is a bunny boiler! She's utterly mad. In <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk">The Sun</a> today there is an article reporting how she's tried to convince poor Stuart to go with her when he leaves the house and not see his family. She won't leave him alone, she follows him, she's all over him, she's crazy!
As all housemates are up for eviction this week, it has to be Michelle that goes for Stuart's sake and the fact she's driving me up the wall!
Lock up your rabbits when she gets out!!!
