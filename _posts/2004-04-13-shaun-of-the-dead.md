Oh yes, the first Romzom film to be released. Romzom you say? Yes, Romantic Comedy with Zombies.Simon Pegg, star of amungst other things "Spaced" wrote and starred in this very very funny film. A definate fried gold (thanks Jam) moment. Go look at <a href="http://uip.co.uk/romzom/">UIP's site</a> for more. A full 5/5 for this one. Can't wait for the DVD :)
