<a title="Ananova - Man's longstanding condition draws a crowd in hospital" href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_891867.html?menu=news.quirkies.unlucky">Ananova - Man's longstanding condition draws a crowd in hospital</a>A man has become a tourist attraction in the Dominican Republic after admitting himself to hospital with an erection that had lasted six days.Staff at Jose Maria Cabral and Baez hospital in Villa Gonzalez said nurses, doctors and members of the public had turned up to glimpse his predicament for themselves.Terra reports that unfortunate Igancio Cabrera, 25, was told by doctors that urgent surgery was required because untreated the condition could have left him impotent.The hospital's director told the paper that since Mr Cabrera denied taking sexual stimulants, he could be suffering from a rare form of anaemia that can give men erections for long periods of time.
