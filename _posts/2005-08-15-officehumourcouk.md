Well it's update time again, Google seemed to have stopped mucking about now and <a href="http://www.office-humour.co.uk">office-humour.co.uk</a> is back up at number 3 for a search for "humour", it was at 2 but seems be jumping about a bit right now.
There are some changes coming as well, nothing major really. The backend is getting a makeover to make it a bit more efficient and also the layout is being redone into CSS which should make it a bit lighter and quicker.
It's also going to become part of the office-hours.co.uk network along with <a href="http://www.office-games.co.uk">office-games.co.uk</a> and a few new sites which will be reering their heads very soon (hopefully!).
As always if you've got any suggestions for the site please let us know.
