Apple have announced an event for September 9th which isn't a huge surprise. I also don't think this time that the releases anounced will be. Seems pretty likly that iTunes 8 will appear along with new iPods in some shape of form. An iPhone update would be welcome, mail on my 3G phone crashes regularly since the 2.0.2 update.
As for anything else, not really sure what they might announce. New iPhones, unlikely. Maybe Macbook Pros of Cinema Displays but they've been floating about for a while now.
