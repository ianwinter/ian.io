<a class="button" href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" title="Get Firefox - Web Browsing Redefined"><img src="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/buttons/getfirefox_large3.png" width="178" height="60" hspace=10 border="0" alt="Get Firefox" align="left"></a> The latest offering from <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> is Firefox. You've seen it before but it's gotten itself a new name. Firefox is the new name for Firebird. The version is 0.8 and it's great! Installer works well, new download manager very cool, tab browsing is brilliant not sure how we've managed without it. Shame old slow clunky Micro$oft haven't managed to be arsed to release a browser that can do it!Anyway, go get Firefox
