If you've ever used UNIX for web design and graphics work you'll have probably come across <a href="http://www.gimp.org/windows/" target="_blank">GIMP</a>. GIMP is a free image editing package. Reason for this post is that they do a Windows version which I found whilst looking for something else.
Hope it helps someone, not that exciting but hey.
