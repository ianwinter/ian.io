Just listened to DJ Yoda in the Live Lounge on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1">Radio 1</a> on Steve Lamacq's show. Yoda played 3 sets all of which were excellent. Hopefully they'll put the it up on listen again, if they do I'll pop the URL up. In the meantime go on over to <a href="http://www.antidoterecords.co.uk">Antidote Records</a> to find out more about Yoda.
