If you've got a Kenwood Z838W head unit you may have noticed that the backlight will
keep inverting which, no doubt, is driving you mad. Well not anymore. It's a feature that
Kenwood say is designed to save the life of the screen, fair enough, but if you want to
stop it you can, it can be disabled by a specific reset sequence.
<strong>The Sequence</strong>
<ol>
<li>Turn unit to "ALL OFF" source mode</li>
<li>Hold down the 1 and AM buttons</li>
<li>Press the reset button</li>
<li>Keep holding 1 and AM until the unit reset's</li>
<li>Done.</li>
</ol>
