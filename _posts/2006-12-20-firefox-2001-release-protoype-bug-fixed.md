<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox 2.0.0.1</a> has been released fixing a number of security bugs but, more handily the prototype bug with object.extend is now fixed.
The <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=357947">original bugzilla report</a> has the repeatable test case (see comment 4) to test.
