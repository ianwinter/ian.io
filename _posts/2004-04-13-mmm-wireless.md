Got myself a <a href="http://www.netgear.com/products/prod_details.php?prodID=223">Netgear DG834G</a> (54 Mbps Wireless ADSL Firewall Router) all up and running now with <a href="http://www.bulldogdsl.com/residential/products/alltime/a500.asp">Bulldog's Alltime 500</a>, cheaper than BT as well, always good. Next challenge is get the DynDNS stuff working. Anyway the point, would strongly recommend the DG834G, nice looking, nice admin, nice in general. Got a WC511 card running with it which again was easy to install and it works, not like the crappy Linksys stuff I tried, works fine on 98 but XP, oh no... that though is another story.
