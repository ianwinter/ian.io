It's quite sad really, but I think it's very cool...
I need to get a letter couriered to Thunder Bay in Canada asap. That's around 4,500 miles give or take a hundred. Having looked at a few included FedEx, ParcelForce and UPS decided to go with DHL. 
Called the drop centre in Reading and if the package was dropped off before 5PM today, it'll be on a plane tonight, overnight to Thunder Bay sorted and delivered door to door tomorrow morning Canadian time by midday. Now that's pretty impressive! The tracking site is also geek-tastically good, at time or writing this the last update showed it sitting in the sorting depot at Heathrow.
Nice.
