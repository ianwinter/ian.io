The fitness campaign continues and seemingly still going OK. Last week wasn't particularly good with only one trip due to a couple of late nights at work and general stuff going on. Over the weekend that was slightly made up for with a 8km cycle in the gym following by some arm weights, on Sunday I managed to up my swimming distance to 1100m (44 lengths). It did take slightly longer at 50 minutes but hopefully that'll come down.
So far not much sign of weight loss, though that I'm not too fussed about as long as the belly decreases it's presence!
