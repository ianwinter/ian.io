<a href="http://www.farnborough.com">Farnborough</a> airshow is running at the moment and I'm working in an office about 3 miles away. We've just had a 30 minute display by the <a href="http://www.redarrows.com/">Red Arrows</a> and it was amasing. At one point flying over the office at no more than <span title="1 000 feet = 304.8 meters">1,000 feet</a>.
Photos to follow once I've sorted out the image manipulation stuff.
