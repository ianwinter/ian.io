Found <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/uk/security/protect/update.mspx">this</a> on M$ site:
"The Windows Security Update CD contains security updates released by Microsoft through to 15 October 2003 for the Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 98 and Windows Me operating systems. It's particularly useful if you use a dial-up connection, as you can install all updates in one session without tying up your phone line. Once installed, you can then maintain the stability, security and reliability of your system by enabling Automatic Updates, to make sure your computer is kept fully updated."
What's more it's free, even the shipping, no need for 150-200MB downloads.
