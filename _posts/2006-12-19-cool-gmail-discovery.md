I think this is cool, even if no-one else does! Got an email today from an old colleague wishing me Merry Christmas, nothing out the ordinary there, but, when I looked at the details in gmail the email address I saw was "first.lastname@gmail.com" with a little note "(Yes, this is you)" by the side of it.
When I clicked on the <a href="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?ctx=%67mail&hl=en&answer=10313">find out more</a> link I learnt that gmail ignores dots (.) in usernames. So, when all those people have asked "all one word?" on me giving out my email I can now say no, first.last or firstlast.
Mmm, geek.
