Both England and Reading won today, England beat Italy 20-7, though it was far from an impressive display. The Autumn form is unfortunately back. It's a shame as the Scotland game last week, which I was at, was excellent.
Reading also got a 2-0 result over Villa at home. Currently 6th and are on a role. Steve Coppell is doing a great job and Majedski's pre season comment about a place in Europe might not be fair off!
Now off for some celebration drinking!
