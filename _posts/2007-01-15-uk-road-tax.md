Not a habit to post email chain style letters, but, this one is actually important and will stop the government charging us the British tax payer even more to drive on the roads!

THIS IS REAL AND IT IS A PROPER GOVERNMENT SITE!
The government's proposal to introduce road pricing will mean you having to purchase a tracking device for your car and paying a monthly bill to use it.
The tracking device will cost about &pound;200 and in a recent study by the BBC, the lowest monthly bill was &pound;28 for a rural florist and &pound;194 for a delivery driver.
A non working Mum who used the car to take the kids to school paid &pound;86 in one month.
On top of this massive increase in tax, you will be tracked. Somebody will know where you are at all times. They will also know how fast you have been going, so even if you accidentally creep over a speed limit* you can expect and additional fine with your monthly bill.
If you care about our freedoms and stopping the constant bashing of the car driver, please sign the petition on No 10's new website
