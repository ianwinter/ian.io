I've decided to take a leap and try moving all the sites I host into the cloud. Currently I've got a dedicated server but it doesn't really do a lot most of the time and the pay for usage idea appeals. I've got a cloud server over at Mosso (soon to be The Rackspace Cloud) running CentOS 5.3 and I'm also in the process of getting Railo server / Resin running to handle the CFML stuff. So far it's going OK.
Few things that I needed to get resin to compile, like gcc, glibc-devel, openssl-devel, openssl but aside from that pretty easy. I'll try and write up a step by step guide when it's working.
