Other than causing me a huge amount of grief there doesn't seem to much at all in the latest firmware for the iPhone.
The update downloaded OK, installed OK, but when the iPhone restarted iTunes crashed and burnt. Restarted iTunes and plugged the iPhone back in and after a while it popped up. Next problem was it told me it was synced to another iTunes, which it wasn't, and wouldn't sync. Did a restore, but, nothing changed. Finally chose the erase and sync option and luckily it sorted it out. I think.
Now to sort my album art out so coverflow looks prettier :)
