OK so the Wii rocks, but, this looks like it's going to get even better!
Here's a story over on <a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/pages/news/story.php?sid=6169919&part=rss&tag=gs_news&subj=6169919">Gamespot</a> about the Wii Blaster, how much fun!
Also found out that Nintendo UK are moving into the offices opposite where I work. Very cool.
