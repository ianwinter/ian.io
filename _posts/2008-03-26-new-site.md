It's actually launched! Using Ray Camden's BlogCFC, dpSyntaxHighligher & LightWindow (see comments) so thanks to all respective authors. This is possibly the quickest it's taken me from saying I'm going to do it to actually, well, doing it!
Gone for the light on dark approach this time, fully CSS'd (no it's probably not valid) and I'm really pleased with it.
