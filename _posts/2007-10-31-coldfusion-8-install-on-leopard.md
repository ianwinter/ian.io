Having read many articles and endured much swearing this morning I finally got CF8 running with apache 2.2.6 on Leopard with my Macbook.
For information it's a Intel Core 2 Macbook which had a completely clean, erase and install version of Leopard on.
I've writing a guide to the steps I took for reference but I was following <a href="http://blog.daemon.com.au/go/blog-post/how-to-install-coldfusion-8-on-leopard-osx">this guide</a> by Geoff Bowers (thanks!) and also reading comments on <a href="http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2007/10/27/Running-ColdFusion-8-on-Leopard">Mark  Drew's</a> post. Going to try on my Mac Mini tonight which is an upgraded version of Leopard from Tiger.
