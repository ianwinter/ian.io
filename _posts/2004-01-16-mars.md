[Beagle 2](http://www.beagle2.com/index.htm) it appears has gone missing. The [announcement](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3376343.stm) was given yesterday which is a shame. Although the Yanks may have there one working at least we landed first :) Relating to the US lead program I found some stuff.

They've released the data which has been sent back and you can download a funky Java app to view the data. You can get it over at [Maestro Headquarters](http://mars.telascience.org/). Full information on the project is available at the [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov) site. I reckon in the spirit of it all NASA should send the Spirit Rover to go find Beagle, but hey, what are the odds of that.

I've got a conspiracy theory though, I reckon the little green men are stealing all the probes and stuff we send up and running their own version of [Scrapheap Challenge](http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/S/scrapheap/). Somewhere on Mars there's a pile of our technology and some aliens having a whale of a time. Anyway, back on Earth...

**Note**
The Maestro link for the app doesn't work 13 years later so here's one that seems to be the [same thing](http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/maestro.html).
