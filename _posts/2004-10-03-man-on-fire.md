Went to see a preview screening of the new Denzel Washington film, <a href="http://www.manonfiremovie.com">Man On Fire</a> this morning. In short, it's excellent, a must see.
Denzel plays Creasy a former Marine who swears vengeance on those who committed an unspeakable act against the family he was hired to protect. Based in Mexico City he is bodyguard to Pita (Dakota Fanning).
The plot is clever and keeps you involved all the time, probably the best film I've seen this year, and one of the best I've seen Washington in. It's about 2 and half hours but it's well worth it. Released in the UK this Friday.
