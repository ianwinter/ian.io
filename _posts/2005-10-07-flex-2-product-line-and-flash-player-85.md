I've had a bit of a play with Flex 1.5 and it's nice, very nice but I don't see how it's going to go mainstream with the ridiculous cost! It's going to be hard for any organisation to justify the cost.
Hopefully now Zorn is coming along and now that MM are part of the Eclipse foundation they'll bring costs down. Only thing on the side you have to wonder about is with a big organisation like MM joining Eclipse will that influence it to much, who knows, time will tell. We've the 'Macrodobe' thing to actually happen yet which seems to have gone quiet. Guess these things take time though.
