Well, new design and new version of <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com">BlogCFC</a> (Cheers Ray!) is all in place.
It's not finished by a long shot, need to do some caching on the <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> feed and also figure out where the hell to put my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flatpackedworld/">flickr</a> photos. The entry pages still need some work; comments I'm going to put inline I think along with trackbacks (if I turn it on). Thinking some nice <a href="http://script.aculo.us">script.aculo.us</a> stuff, just because really.
For now, I'm quite happy with it.
