Just getting into using <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and have been busy uploading <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flatpackedworld">photos</a> . Logged in last night however to find it's gone from beta to gamma status and with it got a whole load of changes.
The organiser is now full screen and non flash, it's been ajax'ed royally and to be honest not sure it's as nice to use. Other noticable changes are the drop down menus up the top which again I'm not sure about.
Time will tell as will user feedback, I'm sure I'll get use to it. Next on the list is playing with API to get photos inline on the site.
