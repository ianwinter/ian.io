You may or may not believe it but a Google Beta application has actually been released. <a href="http://desktop.google.com/about.html" target="_blank">Google Desktop Search</a> version 1 is now available for download.
What is it? From the horse's mouth:
"Google Desktop Search is how our brains would work if we had photographic memories. It's a desktop search application that provides full text search over your email, computer files, chats and web pages you've viewed. By making your computer searchable, Desktop Search puts your information easily within your reach and frees you from having to manually organize your files, emails and bookmarks."
