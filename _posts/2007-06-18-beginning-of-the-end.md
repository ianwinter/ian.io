Could HD-DVD be dead? A lot of people rumoured that once a so called "main player" went one way or the other it could sway the market.
With <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6762621.stm">Blockbuster's</a> decision to go Blu-ray in over 1500 of it's US stores you've got to think it could be a swaying factor.
Still not going to buy one just yet mind you!
