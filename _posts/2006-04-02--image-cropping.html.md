Following on from the previous post and another DHTML need for some image cropping widgets also found this example from <a href="http://www.speedingrhino.com/cropper.htm" target="_blank">Speedingrhino</a>. The DHTML image cropping interface us really neat! 
Hooked up with the some Coldfusion to do image resizing (or the <a href="http://www.alagad.com/" target="_blank">Alagad</a> ImageCFC you could create a nifty little UI.
