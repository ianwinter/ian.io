Taken from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5207756.stm#films" target="_blank">BBC NEWS Entertainment</a> section. The top 50 films to see before you die according to cinema experts.
Some I've never heard of, some I've seen some and haven't. Fight Club, Scarface, Donnie Darko all good choices. Apocalypse Now also deserves to be there.
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
