So just got ColdFusion 9 Beta 2 up and running and my old <a href="https://archive.ianwinter.co.uk/2008/02/28/coldfusion-possible-leap-year-bug/">leap year bug</a> is still there. I've posted a public bug, <a href="http://cfbugs.adobe.com/cfbugreport/flexbugui/cfbugtracker/main.html#bugId=78713" target="_blank">#78713</a> now the tracker has been launched. It effects 7, 8 &amp; 9 so hopefully it'll get fixed!
