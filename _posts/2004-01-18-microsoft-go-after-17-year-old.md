[This](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/34955.html) is a bloody joke. Microsoft have decided that the domain name [mikerowesoft.com](http://www.mikerowesoft.com) is breaking the copyright laws. Got sent a link to the article which is posted on [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/34955.html). Come on Microsoft, don't take the piss! You going to sue anyone that writes your name on a website now!!! EDIT - oops shouldn't have said the "M" word, they'll be after me.
