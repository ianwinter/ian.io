Now you can call me a cynic if you like but I don't care. This is nothing to do with spam is just greedy Gates after yet more of our hard earner money. If it's not enough with Tony Blair taxing everything we work for leaving us with f*** all, we now have good 'ol Gates jumping on the band wagon.
Grr.
