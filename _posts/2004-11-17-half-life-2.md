Finally yesterday <a href="http://www.half-life2.com">Half-Life 2</a> got released.
After waiting about 20 minutes for <a href="http://www.steampowered.com">Steam</a> to unlock the files it eventually began loading up. Had a free voucher from my last graphics card hence using Steam to get it.
Downside before I'd even started was it took an age to load, I was watching the initial load screen for another 10 minutes before I got going, but boy was it worth the wait!
The graphics are out of this world, the introduction movie when you start is brilliant. Go get it now.
