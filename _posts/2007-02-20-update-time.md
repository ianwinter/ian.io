Some of you may know as well as being a day to day web developer for <a href="http://www.rawnet.com">Rawnet</a> I'm also the Technical Director over at <a href="http://www.caffeinepress.co.uk">Caffeine Press</a>, a company I founded with an ex-colleague and mate back in 2004.
The site has recently been re-launched with a nice web2.0 tastic design and UI elements. There's plenty more to come on the site with a lot more detail going to be added to the portfolio about the sites and some pretty little thumbnails (probably off alexa's service but tbc) and also a blog keeping you in the loop as to what we're up to and what's coming soon on the sites. I won't say any more but off the back of FOWA day 1 it's confirmed so ideas we were planning are definitely worth pushing on.
flatpackedworld is far from done either. I've got a load of code I want to publish and also still need to finish the design. Comments need to be done and the archive pages are going to be hidden away a bit in favour of a nice tag cloud type thing (not sure exactly what just yet), also need to work on my stream to hook in flickr, twitter, last.fm and del.icio.us updates.
Got a side track idea on the "stream" thing, but, not sure if it as any legs yet and is still very much a "in my head" idea, hey you never know it might work.
