Scissor Sisters a little bit different but very good, the single Comfortable Numb, a <em>Rolling Stones</em> cover has been played a lot on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1">BBC Radio 1</a> but it's good.The other album Joss Stone's debut, The Soul Sessions, oh my god, it's amazing! Her voice is unbelievably good. The album includes a cover of the <em>Toploader</em> song <em>Some Kind Of Wonderful</em>, and I have to say her version's better. You can get some background on this 16 year old wonder stuff from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,1125514,00.html">this article</a> on The Guardian's site. Not only is her voice incrediable, she's quite attractive too!
