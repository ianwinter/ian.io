Wifi properly sucks, seems Ryan Carson is annoyed, but, for a web conference should have been sorted out. Hey ho.
Chap from thinkfree.com didn't have much to say though the application they've developed and the viewer.thinkfree.com allowing you to put xls, doc, ppt on your site with MSO is very cool.
Quick talk from a Google guy who didn't really say much, just a quick overview on the fact they've got some api's and about the workshops they're holding tomorrow.
At the moment listening to the CTO from Amazon who so far is talking about some very high level resource model stuff. I get the feeling he might have quite a big brain and a bigger bank balance!
