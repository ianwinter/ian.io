Well here it is, another new design. Nice and simple this time, no clutter. Got the very nice Blog CFC by Raymen Camden powering it (with some mod's of course). Hopefully it'll stay a bit more upto date as well. 
Going to bring in all the old stuff from the old blog, but that'll take some time. Also you can expect some code examples, tutorials, my recent experiences with getting CFMX, Apache 1.3 and RHES3 going. 
Still working on the layout a bit, like the paragraphs still merging into one, but hey. It'll get there, as will the admin bits, like adding smiley support and some kind of psuedoHTML editor, either <a href="http://pixeljunkie.org/demo/PseudoHTML/index.cfm">this one</a> or <a href="http://www.fckeditor.net/Demo/">that one</a>.
