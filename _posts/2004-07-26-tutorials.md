I've written up a couple of tutorials which you can now have a look at. Both are on <a href="http://www.easycfm.com">EasyCFM.com</a> but I've duplicated them here.
<ul>
<li><a href="/coldfusion/tutorials/lost_admin_password.cfm">Reset Lost Admin Password</a>
<li><a href="/coldfusion/tutorials/changing_dev_edition_ip.cfm">Change Developer Edition IP</a> - 5 & MX
</ul>
Going to have a new pod for all this stuff and some new content as well soon.
