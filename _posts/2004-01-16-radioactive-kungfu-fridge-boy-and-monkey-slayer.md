Not that I condone monkey slaying, 'cause it's wrong and monkeys are great but hey, anyway. The subject refers of course to [Ross Noble](http://www.rossnoble.co.uk/). I saw Ross' latest show *Unrealtime* a while back and it was great, very very amusing. I'd recommend it to anyone. Just listening to his first CD hence the need to post something.
