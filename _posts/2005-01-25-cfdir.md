I wrote this a couple of years back but it's only just made it round to getting back on the site.
It's a customtag called cf_dir which is an enhancement of cfdirectory and basically lets you filter on more than one filetype.
<div class="code"><cf_dir 
   basedir="C:inetpubwwwroot" 
   exts="htm,cfm,asp"
   queryname="dirContents"></div>
All the attributes should be fairly self explanitory. You can <a href="/coldfusion/code/cf_dir.cfm">download</a> the code (right click and save as) or <a href="##" onclick="launchCodeView('/coldfusion/code/cf_dir.cfm');">view the code</a>.
