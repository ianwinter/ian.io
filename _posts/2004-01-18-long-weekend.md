Off to Paris tomorrow morning for a long Valentines weekend break. Should be good, never been before so looking forward to it. Think we'll go down to Disney for a day as well as it's only 30 minute on the train from the (Gare De Nor) station. Hopefully get some good pics of "stuff" and from the top of the Eiffel Tower.
