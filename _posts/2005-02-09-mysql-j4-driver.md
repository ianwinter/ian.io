Following my previous post MM haven't shipped the MySQL J 4 driver with CF7 as it's not entirely stable and there seems too be some <a href="http://internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3358061">licensing issues</a>. NewAtlanta have also not shipped this driver with Bluedragon. 
If you need to install it with CF7 you can do, there is both a <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=6ef0253">technote</a> and a post over on <a href="http://www.talkingtree.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=25AA9A56-45A6-2844-7A60CF5B3666D010">Steven Erat's</a> blog.
