Been quiet on the posting front lately, mainly because Sky Broadband suck. OK, so that's a bit harsh, their customer service department suck. Pipex also suck.
Basically moved from Pipex to Sky, mainly due to cost as bundled from Sky saves me overall around &pound;25 per month. No brainer. Also would get a faster connection.
Not going to go into the long winded detail right now, but basically the ADSL migration process still sucks and is unreliable. Since being with Sky for just over 4 weeks, just over 3 of them have been without connection. If you want to migrate at the moment I think cancel the old and start up with the new is more reliable!
