I had a need, a need to change some tables in MySQL from MyISAM to InnoDB. I did a few via regular SQL and then thought there must be an easier way and indeed there is.
Maatkit (which if you haven't heard of go Google it) can help. The following one liner will neatly switch all the tables in one go. Lovely.
```
mk-find -uroot wld --engine MyISAM --tblregex '^payment' \
--exec "alter table %D.%N engine=InnoDB" --print
```
FYI you can get this from a "yum install maatkit" as well.
