Saw POTC3 at the weekend and was overall pleased. It's a bit longer than it needs to be and in places can get a bit confusing but there is some comedy moments and great Captain Jack sound bites. If you've seen the other 2 it does clear up a few things as well!
One thing, if you go and you haven't seen it already sit it out through the end credits. There's more. Is it worth the 3+ minutes of credits wait? I'll let you decide.
