Trip to Paris over Valentines was excellent. Went up the Eiffel Tower (to the top!), Notre Dame all the other tourist bits and bobs. Also spent a day in Disney at the Park and in the Studios, always good for laugh. Bloody expensive though, and full of French. Ah well, been there now so don't have to go back... muhahahah... anyway.
