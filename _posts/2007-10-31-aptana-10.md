I changed over to using Aptana from Eclipse a while ago now and haven't looked back. It works fine with CFEclipse, subclipse and also has the benefit of built in CSS/JS support and optional AIR, PHP and Rails plugins.
Anyway, they've just released version 1 and also a slightly more feature filled "Pro" version.
