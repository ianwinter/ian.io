A 3-1 win over Stoke today pushes Reading to 102pts in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/default.stm">the Championship</a> with 2 games and them needing 4 points to get to the magical all time points record of 106 which would beat Sunderlands 105.
Coppel's target is not to loose until the end of the season, so hopefully another 2 wins or at least a win and a draw and it'll be home and dry.
Almost put a bet on a while back but glad I didn't as I don't think I'd take the pressure at the moment!
