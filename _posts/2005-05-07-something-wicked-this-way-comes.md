No, not The Herbaliser album, though that's very good, this is the Derren Brown 2005 tour.
Again at the <a href="http://www.readingarts.com">Hexagon</a> in Reading saw this on Friday night and I have to say I was impressed. I've been very sceptical to say the least of his TV shows in the past but always intrigued none the less.
Having seen him live and some of the stuff he does, he's good, he's very good. The power of suggestion and the way he gets people to do things is not only scary, clever but very inevitable (one for anyone else there ;) )
It was well worth the money there's plenty more dates on <a href="http://www.derrenbrown.co.uk/tour">his tour</a> so if there's one near you, off you go. It's inevitable.
