Is you Macbook casing cracked? Just above the power light on the right frond hand side where your palm goes. Mine did, as has a colleague's.
Called Apple up and go it replaced under warranty (less than 2 months old!) but it wasn't easy. That said the servive provided, Rapid, were excellent. Booked it in Thursday, dropped it off Friday, part ordered Monday, arrived and fitter on Tuesday. Result.
I still love it. Hopefully it's not going to crack again.
