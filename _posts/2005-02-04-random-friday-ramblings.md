So, it's Friday you're bored, he's some "stuff". The <a href="http://www.bbspot.com/News/2005/02/website_quiz.php">Website Personailty Quiz</a> is interesting, apparently I'm MSN, though, not convinced about that in the slightest!
Then you have the <a href="http://www.dadgum.com/giantlist/list.html">ultimate list of games programmers</a> which is vaguely interesting but this guy needs to get out more!
You've got <a href="http://www.office-humour.co.uk/item.cfm?itm=2634">NumaNuma</a> for which sound is essential!
Lastly the quite scarey news from <a href="http://www.chrismoyles.net">Chris Moyles</a> this morning on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/">Radio 1</a> that the f****** crazy frog dance remix is going to be released. Wow. Yay. Erm, aaaaaaaahhhhh.
