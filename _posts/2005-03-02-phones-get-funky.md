We all know mobile phones are no longer just a way to talk to other people, they've become much more. With the 3G era upon us (apparently) this announcement from Sony Ericsson simply pushes that fact. 
The first <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/article.aspx?art=1104" target="_blank">walkman branded phone</a>, the W800, also announced the K750 and a couple of others.
All these phones also have 2 megapixel cameras, pretty neat!
