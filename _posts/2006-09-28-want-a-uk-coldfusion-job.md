Do you? If you do and know Coldfusion then let me know. The award winning UK digital media company I work for in Windsor are in the market for some very cool individuals to join an expanding team.
Obviously it's a CF job, so, CF is a must. Other stuff which will help you is MySQL (3.x, 4.x), MS SQL (other DB's always good), Flex, AJAX, JS, HTML (naturally). Any Flex, Actionscript knowledge is always welcome as is Ruby.
Like I say, if you're interested drop me a line and at least come in for an interview. We don't give shit jobs and we are big, we are funny and we are clever!
