The company I work for is looking for a like minded, experienced developer to join our expanded team (currently of 5).
You must have at least 4 years commercial experience in Coldfusion v6+, have worked with MySQL, Eclipse, SVN and Linux. CSS, Ajax, JavaScript are a given as is a good understanding of current web technologies and application development life cycle. Any experience of Ruby will greatly help.
Aside from the work stuff you need to be a cool geek, like music (we're big on last.fm), photo's (naturally flickr), annoy people with randomness on twitter.
If you're going to the Future of Web Apps conference let me know as we'll all be there, if not, drop me a mail.
