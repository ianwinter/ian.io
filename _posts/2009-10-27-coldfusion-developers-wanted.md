We&rsquo;re looking for a ColdFusion developer to join our team of 15 developers and designers at WhiteLabelDating.com. We&rsquo;re focused on creating the very best online dating platform in the industry. We&rsquo;re highly profitable, growing quickly and want to recruit the best people to work with our experienced team and be a part of our future.
We&rsquo;re based at 1 High Street in the centre of Windsor, west of London. We&rsquo;re easily commutable from London (West from Paddington or South-West direct from Waterloo), Reading, Staines or Slough.
Our core application is written ColdFusion and we&rsquo;re looking for someone to join the team to help maintain and improve all areas of the code. This would be an ideal role for an intermediate level developer looking to improve their skill set and also diversify into other languages and frameworks such as Ruby on Rails. We are currently investigating architecture changes and someone with an interest in cloud computing, sphinx and highly available database systems would be a great asset.
