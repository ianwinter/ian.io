You might notice that you're now being bounced to archive.ianwinter.co.uk for all posts. I'm planning to move home over to ian.io. Right now you'll end up in a loop of death until the holding page is finished.
Plan isn't set, but, I might move over to jekyll, I might stay with wordpress, I might just not blog as much, I don't know!
Either way it'll change and I don't have a new design yet.
