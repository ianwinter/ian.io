Steve Jobs announced it'd be out in February and so far no sign. The ever reliable rumour mill is churning as normal with Apple and ranges from a 3G version of the iPhone, a 1.1.4 firmware (seems logical to support the SDK) and a big Apple event to actually launch the SDK itself.
It will be good to get it out there, I think custom apps will make the iPhone even better than it is already and will allow people to fix things that are irritating. Like for instance about 5 taps to turn bluetooth on, not friendly when you want to turn in on before setting out on a car journey!
