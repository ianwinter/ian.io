You've probably heard by now the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/medic/fitness/tracks/London%20Underground.mp3">"london underground"</a> song, if you haven't and live in the UK you need to. Point your browser and <a href="http://www.amateurtransplants.com/" target="_blank">amateur transplants</a> site, the home of the song.
The album arrived in the post the other day and now I've listened to it a couple of times it really is very very good. They say it's likely to offend which it might, only the language really, wouldn't suggest playing to anyone under the age of 15!
Go and support these 2 guys by buying the album, and no, I'm not on commision.
