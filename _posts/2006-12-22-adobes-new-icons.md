Adobe's <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/images/wheel-o'-icons.html">new product</a> icon's have been making quite a few waves in the blogsphere and to be honest I can see why.
Initial reaction has to be that it's based on the Periodic table, perhaps the designer is a science buff? Letters in boxes may be web2.0, but, it's product identification and branding, I can't help think that a little more thought should have gone into it. Then again, I'm no graphics designer, but, I'm not sure I'd have signed it off!
