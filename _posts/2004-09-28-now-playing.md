Just installed a Winamp plugin called <a href="http://www.cc.jyu.fi/~ltnevala/nowplaying/index.php">Now Playing</a> by Lauri Nevala. The version on the site that I've just installed is 1.4.1, and guess what there's a pod for Blog CFC coming soon :)
<strong>Edit:</strong> Slight change of plan, now using <a href="http://www.oddsock.org/tools/dosomething/">DoSomething</a> plugin to generate a file. Working on the pod and should be sorted soon ish.
<strong>Edit (again):</strong> OK, think I may quit on this one, can't get either working as I'm at work behind the firewall. Rah.
