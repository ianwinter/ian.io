As you'll have probably seen by now, the next Star Wars film has it's official title. <a href="http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/news20040724.html">Revenge Of The Sith</a>. Looking forward to seeing what they do with this one. The original 3 are of course better, though the new "prequels" do fill a hole and the transformation to Vader should be good. Now all we have to do is wait until May 19, 2005.
