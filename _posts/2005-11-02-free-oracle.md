Sorta. It's 'free to develop, deploy, and distribute'. From the site:
"Oracle Database 10g Express Edition (Oracle Database XE) is an entry-level, small-footprint database based on the Oracle Database 10g Release 2 code base that's free to develop, deploy, and distribute; fast to download; and simple to administer."
Certainly a great way to test your apps against a Oracle DB for no cost.
