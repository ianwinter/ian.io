About 2 years ago, maybe more, I remember finding a new, free statistics service called <a href="http://www.reinvigorate.net/">Reinvigorate/</a>. It seems that after disappearing and doing nothing since it's popped back up with a beta program.
I got an invite this morning and flatpackedworld is now running the tracking code so we'll see how it holds up. Had a quick look around and it seems nice, good UI and seems pretty quick.
If you want an invite go to the site and hit the link. It currently says:
<blockquote><p>
We periodically invite new groups of people into the beta, about every week(ish) or so. This helps us mitigate any unexpected server load while we fine tune and tweak our systems.
</blockquote>
