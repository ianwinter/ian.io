Almost finished watching <a href="http://www.jerryspringertheopera.com/jerry_opera.html">The Jerry Springer Opera</a> on BBC 2 and I think it's very good. The music is great, the singer's, choreography are all very good.
It's come up for a lot of critism by religious groups, which, I'm not going to get too far involved with because my religion of which I'm proud is Jedi, but anyway. They should just shut up and let it be to be honest. It's a bit of a rant this but needs to be said. 
The UK is a country of free speech and as such I think the BBC are right to show it. If people don't like it they don't have to watch it do they?
Soapbox moment over. More information on the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4154071.stm">BBC coverage</a>
