This year's <a href="http://www.mxeurope.org/">MX Europe</a> dates and site are now up and running. It's on from the 6th-8th September 2004 up at the Olympia Conference Centre in Kensington, London, UK. I'm hopefully going to be going this year certainly for 1 if not 2 days. Worth a look. Also check out the <a href="http://www.ukcfug.co.uk">UK CF User Group</a> which is one of the participating European CFUG's.
