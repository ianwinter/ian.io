Whilst we're on a film theme, you really should (if you haven't already) go and see Shrek 2. It's really funny, there are some many references to other films and mickey takes it's great.
The kids may love the graphics and stuff but adults certainly will benefit from the jokes and film references, definitely one to get on DVD once released. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000C47LJ/qid=1090857482/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_10_2/026-0838169-2499635">Amazon</a> have a page where you can get notified of the release.
Oh and look out for the Burger King logo.
