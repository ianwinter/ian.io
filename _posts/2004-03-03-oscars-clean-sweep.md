The <a href="http://www.oscars.com">76th Oscar's</a> were held last night over in Hollywood and The Lord Of The Rings - The Return Of The King managed a clean sweep winning 11 out of the 11 it had been nominated for. The trilogy is brilliant and if you haven't seen it yet you've definatley missed out. 
The full list of winners is on the Oscar <a href="http://www.oscars.com/oscarnight/winners/index.html">site</a> or over at the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3433895.stm">BBC</a>.
