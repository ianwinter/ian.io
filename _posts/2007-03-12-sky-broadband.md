My new Sky broadband got hooked up today migrated over from Pipex. All good, line works and get around 220% speed boost from 1 to 2.4 meg. All good.

Not so good is the fact Sky have decided to "customise" the Netgear DG834GT's firmware managing to break port forwarding, they've also broken a few other bits. Overall I can't complain. Also Sky seemingly refuse to give out the actual username and password for connecting making using my old router not possible. No no no, through the wonders of Google I've got the details and this comes to you from my Sky connection on my old router. Easy when you know how and have Google =D
