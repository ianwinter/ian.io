Lord Of The Rings III - Return of The King, wow, how good. Probably one of the best films I've seen. The battle scenes were epic,  the story involved and it although I had doubts if I could sit through 3.5 hours worth or film I did, and it was well worth it.Having had the first 2 DVD collectors box sets for Christmas I can't wait for the 3rd to be released.For those of you who've read the book, it won the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/" >BBC's Big Read</a> competition.
