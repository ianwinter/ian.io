According to the <a href="http://shop.o2.co.uk/info/">O2 store</a> selected retail stores are getting limited stock tomorrow (Wednesday 16th July) and more by Friday 25th. I wonder how long the queue in Reading is already?
Whilst having the 3G and the ability to find myself, geographically speaking, I'm not it's worth it just yet. I might wait 6 months and see what Apple do.
