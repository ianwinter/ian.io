Thank you for your note. 
From time to time we modify the Google logo to celebrate different holidays celebrated by our users around the world. 
Today our logo commemorates the birthday of Gaston Julia, a French mathematician who was instrumental in the study of fractal geometry. This type of mathematics inspired the fractal images depicted in the logo.For more information on fractals, please visit:<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=define%3Afractal">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=...(snipped)</a>For more images of fractals, please visit:
