Managed to upgrade a load of database from MySQL 4.0.x to 4.1.13 & 14 on anther server and got them working with Coldfusion MX 6.1 & 7 using the MySQL/J Connector 3 17 ga drivers. Boring, but, least I can use sub selects now!
Had some fun trying to reinstall perl DBD::mysql and eventually after some trusting swearing and googling established I was missing the MySQL-devel rpm being installed.
