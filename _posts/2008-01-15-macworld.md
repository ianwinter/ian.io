Well I was close. A new Macbook "Air" which for business people or those who travel a lot looks awesome... I want, but, don't need one. An update to the iPhone firmware which was expected along with movie rentals in iTunes so all in all nothing really shocking. The Apple TV upgrades look kinda cool.
To update the iPhone though looks like you have to get iTunes 7.6 first because before I did it didn't work.
