A new version of <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/su_downloads.html">Slimserver</a> (6.5.1) has been released along with some new firmware as well.
My weekend mission, amongst others, is to get some more of my mp3 collection into <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> so I can listen to it all on the <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_squeezebox.html">Squeezebox</a>.
I started at Z on the albums and am working down. Then have soundtracks, compilations, live, comedy and radio shows to tag up. So far got 14,038 songs (40.6 days, 80.92GB) and reckon I'm coming up to 1/4 of the total size and suspect 1/3 of the tracks. =D
