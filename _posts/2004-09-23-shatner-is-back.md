This deserves a post. William Shatner, yes, Captain Kirk sings a cover of Pulp's Common People.
Don't believe me, <a href="http://www.shoutfactory.com/av/common_people.mov">go listen</a> and <a href="http://www.buzzgrinder.com/archives/william_shatner_is_no_has_been.php">read some more</a> or <a href="http://www.benfolds.org/forum/26946">here</a>.
It really is quite shocking.
