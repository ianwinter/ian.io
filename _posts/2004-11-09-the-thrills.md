Saw <a href="http://www.thethrills.com">The Thrills</a> play the first date on their new UK tour supporting the new album <a HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002JKPOU/officehumour-21">Let's Bottle Bohemia</a>
 at the Hexagon in Reading.
It was awesome, the set was great including stuff from the first album (<a HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009AQM9/officehumour-21">So Much for the City</a>
) and of course the new one. Particular favourites included Big Sur, Saturday Night, The Curse Of Comfort, What Ever Happened To Corey Haim & Santa Cruz (closed on).
The lighting was great, when one of the lights got turned off and we could see the stage again, crowd surfing by the 2 guitarists, great encore and standing ovation. If you can get <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/cgi/asp_events/searchresults.asp?criteria=event&searchstring=thrills&affiliate=">tickets</a> I'd recommend you go.
