Been using FF3 now and all seems to be fine and dandy. It's got some nice little additions and new features in which in my  mind make it much better than IE.
Some of the more comedy items you may or may not have seen.
Type in the address bar "about:robots" to be find our some information about robots visiting us in goodwill and "about:config" to to be warned "Here be dragons!" and confirmation buttons of "I'll be careful, I promise!".
It's comedy touches like that which just make it good. Though, I could just be sad or geeky. Ah well :)
