Late to the game but, the public beta of <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion8/">Coldfusion 8</a> is now available on Adobe Labs.
Some really neat looking stuff and enhancements going into this release. Should be good. I think it's rumoured to be "gold" by the end of the year, but, that is purely hearsay.
