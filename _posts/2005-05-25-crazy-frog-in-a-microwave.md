For some time now a certain 'hilarious' video of a computer animated frog-type thing has infested TV advert slots on music video channels.  Now the blight has spread to all commercial channels with alarming frequency of repetition.  This little video is my response.  Join the legions of people who want to kill the annoying little scrote.
