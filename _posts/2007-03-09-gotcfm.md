It's been blogged but late to the game as usual! Rey Bango has setup a new site <a href="http://www.gotcfm.com">GotCFM</a> designed with the purpose of getting a list of Coldfusion powered sites. I think it's a great idea as the more publicity for CF the better.
A cool idea might be some kind of Google maps mashup showing where domains are in the world, could get IP's of the domain names and show it?
Anyway, cool site.
