Got <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/index.html">JDS</a> up and running on my laptop. Surprisingly painless, though configuring the graphic card to use the latest driver was a little bit tricky, had to resort to following a README. How shocking, that's one of those docu.. somethings :-)Also installed <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/coldfusion">ColdFusion MX</a> first time without any problems. Easy as pie.
