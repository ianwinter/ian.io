The mill was in full flow last week with numerous posts about a forthcoming iPhone update, 1.1.3. As is often the case these all basically pointed back to one source website saying it'd be the weekend just gone, but, nothing. I plugged in my iPhone a few times across the weekend and saw no updates.
That said, I hope it does come soon as a voice recorder would be pretty handy and allowing some form of disk usage would be good, even if via iTunes. What I'd really like of course is ability to install applications, but hey ho.
A few people have posted that newly bought iPhones over this weekend have got 1.1.3 on, but, no proof so we'll see if it comes out this week.
