Noticed this a few places now including the <a href="http://blog.netscape.com/2007/12/28/end-of-support-for-netscape-web-browsers/">Netscape Blog</a> and I'm not surprised that Netscape has announced development will no longer continue on the Netscape browser. To be honest I'm surprised it's taken this long to EOL it.
