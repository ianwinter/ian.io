title: Upgrade kernel to mainline
tags: kernel security linux

Why should you upgrade your kernel? There's a bunch of reasons really. Bug fixes get included, they can be faster and add in new features.

There is however the huge caveat that not everyone can. Some things depend on specific kernels to work correctly.

Earlier this week a "bug" became public that has attracted a lot of attention and rightly so as it really is quite bad.

* [Meltdown, Spectre: The password theft bugs at the heart of Intel CPUs](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/04/intel_amd_arm_cpu_vulnerability/)
* [Rush to fix 'serious' computer chip flaws](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42561169)
* [Meltdown and Spectre: How chip hacks work](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42564461)

It's been covered by all the major companies as it affects anything with an Intel processor, and, actually has done for years. Here's some (not all):

* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2018-013/)
* [RHEL](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/speculativeexecution?sc_cid=701f2000000tsLNAAY&)
* [VMWare - ESX](https://www.vmware.com/us/security/advisories/VMSA-2018-0002.html)
