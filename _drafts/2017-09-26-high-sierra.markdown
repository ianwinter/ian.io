With the release of macOS High Sierra, @arstechnica have as ever done a [great review](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/macos-10-13-high-sierra-the-ars-technica-review/) of the OS. It includes things to note, new things and warnings. For me (at least at home) my old iMac might need a scratch build as the fusion drives cause APFS issues in this release.

Other bits you might need is a quick guide to [Create a bootable installer for macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201372) - you'll need an empty 8GB drive.
